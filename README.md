WarmShowers-Windows
===================

This is the home for Warm Showers for WP7, WP8, and Win8 projects.
* Currently only the WP7 app is published to the Marketplace/Store, and is the only source included here.  The native WP7 app also works on WP8.
* To build, load the WarmShowers solution (WarmShowers.sln) into Visual Studio 2012.
* The source is also versioned by Team Foundation Server (TFS), which creates the $tf1 folder.
* The WP7 app is currently in maintenance mode, no major features are planned.  WP8 / Win8 apps are in (very slow) development.
* Visit www.warmshowers.org for more information about the entire Warm Showers ecosystem.
* For bugs, please submit a new github issue or comment on an existing one.
* For questions, comments, or interest in further development of Warm Showers for Windows, contact:
