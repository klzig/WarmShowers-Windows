 Kurt, Lisa and Zoe were amazing hosts, their home was strategically located in a beautifully quiet neighborhood close to the downtown ammenities but far enough removed from the hustle and noise. 
 They offered engaging conversations, warm smiles, relaxed atmosphere...an overall great experience. Thanks again Zieglers!"/>

Just completed an epic cycling adventure with my daughter.  Would enjoy hosting up to three people and hearing about their adventures.  We have a surly but mostly harlmless cat and a dog. I live in Boise's North End and have a spare bedroom\/bathroom suite with, yes, a warm shower of your own."/>
